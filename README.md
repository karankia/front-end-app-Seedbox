The first user gets a symbol X and the second gets O. The users can then fight it out to win the game, once the game has been decided a winner is declared using a modal if its a draw the modal will show it as a draw.
# 2) The second button/route will show you the credits which are being grabbed from an API. You can go back to the main screen using the baack button
# 3) The third route will take you to an external website in this case it is https://www.nasa.gov/
